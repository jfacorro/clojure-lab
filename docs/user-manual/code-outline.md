This control shows you an overview of the elements defined in the file you are working on. The types of elements listed depend on the language associated to the file, if the language has no support for **Code Outline** then no elements will be shown.

In order to enable **Code Outline** for the current file, press the <kbd> Alt </kbd> + <kbd> O </kbd> key combination or click on the menu item **View > Outline**. This will display a new tab in the right section of the application, in which you will be able to see a list.

Every item in that list corresponds to an element defined in the contents of the associated file.

## Moving to the Element

Having a **Code Outline** is particularly useful when working with large files since the amount of elements tends to increase with the size of the file. Finding a specific element can sometimes be quite hard when there are too many of them.

In order to get the cursor in the position where the definition of each element is, double-click on the item or select it and press the <kbd> Enter </kbd> key.

## Finding an Element

It's possible for you to search for a specific element by selecting any of the items in the list and start typing the name of the element. If found this will change the focus to the element with the name you type so you can simply press <kbd> Enter </kbd> and the cursor will be positioned where that element is defined.
