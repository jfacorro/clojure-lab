## Remove a Directory 

To remove a directory you no longer want to work with, select it and then press <kbd>Del</kbd>, this will only remove it from the control, not your file system. The dialog is closed by pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd>.

## Search & Open a Document

Apart from being able to open a file through a traditional file dialog ( **File > Open** ), the **File Explorer** provides a *fast file access dialog*, in which you can enter any part of the name of the file you want to open and a list of possible matches will be offered. 

The search is done in all chlidren of the added directories, if none is added then it will be done on the directory and all subdirectories from which the application was started. This fast file search can be opened through the shortcut <kbd> Ctrl </kbd> + <kbd> Alt </kbd> + <kbd> O </kbd>.
