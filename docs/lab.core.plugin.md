# Plugin

  - Different types of plugin (like keymaps).:
    - `:global`: registered as loaded in the app.
    - `:local`: registered as loaded in the current document.
  - Load a plugin.
    - If the plugin is already loaded then nothing is done.
  - Unload a plugin.
  - Keeps track of what plugins have been loaded.
  - Allow plugins to define their own dependencies (?)
